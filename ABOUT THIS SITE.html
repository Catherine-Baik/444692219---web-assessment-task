    <p>
        There are multiple reasons in which bonus marks should be earnt for this fabulously created website. 
    </p>  
    
    <ol>
   
        <li>There is Javascript which has been used to change the function of a button in the 'Sign Up' page. Additionally, Javascript has been used to create the image carousel to change the functions of the woring image carousel.</li>
        <li>It is certain that I have used well commented HTML, CSS and Javascript. Evidence for this can be shown through all HTML webpages as well as CSS and Javascript files. </li>
        <li>I have used an external CSS file to ensure a consistent look and feel of the site and easy changes to the appearance of the entire site. </li>
        <li>The search bar is somewhat responsive, as when clicked, the user can actively type into the box. Additionally, in the Sign Up and Login pages, the user can type in their email and password, however if they try to login/signup when not all their information has been placed, the site responds with a message saying that 'this field is required'.</li>
        <li>I believe that my website has a great overall appearance, with consistent colours with neat organisation and sections.</li>
        <li>I have used an image carousel in my home page, using fade transitions and automatically changing slides every 5 seconds. This used Javascript.</li>
        <li>I have a 'back to top' button, in which you can go back to the top of the page with ease.</li>
        <li>I have used animation effects to some items, including an image and series of words - these include scaling the size, as well as the 'skew' affect. In my hover transitions, I have also applied transform affects by making it bigger (shown in the navbar), as well as the 'Back to Top' button also being scaled larger when hovered.</li>
        <li>I wrote some of the text, including everything in the about this site page, and song/album rankings (not including the information about each). </li>
        <li>There are several links within pages, shown in the pages 'album reviews', 'favourite songs' and 'about this page'. This is done by either clicking onto the 'back to top' or clicking one of the listed songs/albums. </li>
        <li>I incorporated a progress bar into into the pages that required a lot of scrolling, so the reader could know their progress. This used Javascript.</li>
        <li>I wrote most of the CSS and HTML code myself.</li>
        <li>I have rating bars at the bottom of my home page. </li>
        <li>There is a call-out container in which you can close at the bottom corner of my home page. </li>
        <li>I have added a ribbon to my call out at the bottom of the home page. </li>
        <li>I have added a real-time countdown at the bottom of the home page. It uses Javascript. </li>
        <li>I have incorporated a parallax to my 'About Taylor' page, along with a call-out in the same page.</li>

    <h1 id="title1">COPIED CODE</h1>
  </span>

<span class="list">


    <ol>
   
        <li>In the home page, I have used code from W3schools to create the automatic mage carousel. However, I have changed the dimensions of the image container myself, and also replaced the images with my own.</li>
        <li>In the signup/login pages I have used code from W3schools to create the signup/login format. I have changed the font, font-size and colors.  </li>
        <li>In the 'My Account' page, I have used code from W3schools to create the profile card. I have changed the colours, image, text, font and font-size. </li>
        <li>Some text was generated and copied from ChatGPT. </li>
        <li>I got the code for the progress bar from W3schools, however I made a lot of changes - I removed all the text and header that was in the W3schools version, and changed the colours.</li>
        <li>I got the code for the navigation bar from W3schools, however changed the spacing, text, colour, hover properties, font and font-size.</li>
        <li>I got the code for the ratings bar from W3schools.</li>
        <li>I got the code for the countdown from W3schools.</li>
        <li>I got the code for the parallax from W3schools, however made major changes. This included changing the images, colours, fonts, font-sizes, adding my own lowered opacity block in the center of the top half, changing the dimensions of the middle block as well as adding my original footer.</li>
